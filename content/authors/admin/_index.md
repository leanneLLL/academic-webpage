I'm a rising senior in the Mathematics Department at the University of California, Los Angeles. I'm interested in computer science, network analysis, machine learning, front-end design, data science, and atmospheric and oceanic science.

I am currently looking for a software engineering intern for 2021 summer. I am open to all kinds of career opportunities. Please feel free to contact me.
